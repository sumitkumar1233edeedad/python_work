ðŸ§® Aggregation Functions:
- Given a numpy array, write code to find the minimum, maximum, sum, mean, standard deviation, and variance.
- Create a numpy array of random integers and calculate its aggregation statistics.
- Given a 2D numpy array, find the row-wise and column-wise sums and means.

ðŸ”¢ Array Creation Methods:
- Create numpy arrays filled with zeros, ones, and a specific value using np.zeros, np.ones, and np.full.
- Generate a sequence of numbers using np.arange with different start, stop, and step values.
- Create an identity matrix of a given size using np.eye.
- Create arrays of different shapes and data types using numpy array creation functions.

âž— Element-wise Mathematical Operations:
- Perform element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on numpy arrays.
- Given two numpy arrays, perform element-wise operations and explain broadcasting rules.
- Write code to apply a mathematical function (e.g., square, square root) element-wise on a numpy array.

ðŸš€ Advanced Practice:
- Combine array creation and aggregation: create a large array and compute its statistics.
- Use numpy functions to manipulate arrays (reshape, flatten, transpose) and then perform aggregation.
- Implement a function that normalizes a numpy array using mean and standard deviation.
- Explore numpy's random module to generate arrays and compute their properties.
